# Q8

Based on my knowledge and experience. Statistical presentation of a data type. Here is a college test result report, the best graph to choose is the Box plot. 

Because this graph can easily get information about statistical parameters like median, min, max, upper quartile, lower quartile. Thereby we can also see the outliers.

# Q9 

If the first roll is n, the chance that the two roll after will be less with n always less than 6 is:

Because if n = 6, we have table cases

| 1     | 2     | 3     | 4     |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| (1,1) | (2,1) | (3,1) | (4,1) |
| (1,2) | (2,2) | (3,2) |       |
| (1,3) | (2,3) |       |       |
| (1,4) |       |       |       |

We easily see that the total cases is (n-2) + (n-1)  + .. + 1. So, we have upper equation.

Summation all possible values of n by sum of chance with n from 1 to 6
